# Sorting-Algoritm-Visualiser
Python sorting algorithm visualiser

Issues with tkinter window "not responding" and hanging part way through a run. Background processes of sorting the array continues and then the program stops buffering and shows array fully sorted. 

!- to do -!
-implement more sorting algorithms 
-learn and try to implement threading/multiprocessing
-potentially change visual colours and how colorArray is generated for radix sort
-add counters to show number of comparisons/array accesses?
